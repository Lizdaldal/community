## Project Name 
Filecoin Flavored Ganache 

## Category 
Developer Tooling

## Project Description
Ganache was built as the sister application to Truffle, to speed up development and testing Ethereum applications. Now that we've added support to Truffle, it's only natural we provide the same highly-modular simulator for Filecoin. We are currently creating a Filecoin simulation library, as part of ganache-core. We are also developing support in our graphical version of Ganache. You can checkout some early mocks under previews!
